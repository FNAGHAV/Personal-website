    "\n",
    "        <p>In 2017, I joined the University of Toledo (UT) in the United States as a graduate student in the Department of Biology. Over the next three years, I conducted multiple research projects centered on memory and synaptic plasticity. This period significantly enhanced my independence, work ethic, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, mentoring undergraduates and teaching laboratory courses helped me develop strong teaching abilities and time management skills.</p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "        <p>In May 2020, I transitioned to the UT College of Medicine, where I studied neural circuits related to empathy using advanced techniques such as in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics. This research held the potential to deepen our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying empathy, and fueled my interest in computational studies. To further enhance my analytical capabilities, I earned a Data Analysis Certificate from the University of Pennsylvania's Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp.</p><br>\n",
